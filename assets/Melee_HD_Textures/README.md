First find your Dolphin/Slippi online directory, then go to User > Load > Textures and paste the GALE01 folder there. Then go to Graphics > Advanced and ensure both "Load custom textures" and "Prefetch Custom Textures" are selected. You'll want to check the "Prefetch Custom Textures" option to prevent in-game stuttering.
