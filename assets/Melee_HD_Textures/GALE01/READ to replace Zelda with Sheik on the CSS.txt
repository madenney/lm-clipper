To replace Sheik's portraits over Zelda's, rename the files in the main > css > Sheik (replaces Zelda) folder to remove the "_Sheik" suffix from each. Then go to the Zelda folder, and either delete the files or change the name of each file within the folder, for example adding "_Zelda" suffix to the file name.
